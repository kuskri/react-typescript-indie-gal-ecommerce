            Our Story

            Hi there, we are Anna and Kai, husband and wife and proud
            brain-parents of Lethal Cosmetics. We founded the company in 2016
            because we were struggling to find fun vegan and cruelty-free makeup
            in our home country of Germany. If you can’t buy it, we thought, why
            not make it ourselves? So we did. Anna knew exactly the kind of
            products she was missing and immediately went to town, formulating
            our first eyeshadows and liquid lipsticks, aided by a keen eye for
            color and her background in cosmetic science. In the meantime, Kai
            designed the packaging, built our first online store and served as
            test subject for our early prototypes.

            When we finally launched in early 2017, we really didn’t know what
            to expect. But then we completely sold out in only a few hours and
            things just kept escalating from there.{" "}
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={["md", "lg", "xl"]} marginBottom={5}>
            Today, it’s no longer just the two of us in a tiny lab. We have an
            amazing team, a much bigger lab, almost 100 different products on
            sale and retailers around the world stocking our stuff. But some
            things haven’t changed: we’re still an ethical brand, we’re still
            making everything in house and we’re still having a blast doing it.
            From our signature pressed powder shadows to our liquid lipsticks,
            glosses and highlighters, we just get a kick out of bringing you
            unique, high-performance, ethical makeup at affordable prices. And
            we’re definitely not gonna stop now. So thank you for being along
            for the ride. We don’t know where this train is going, but it’s
            going to be colorful.{" "}

            Our Ethics
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={["md", "lg", "xl"]} marginBottom={5}>
            To us, ethical makeup is more than a catchphrase. It’s at the core
            of everything we do. It defines how we formulate our products, how
            we design our packaging, how we source our raw materials, how we
            interact with you as a customer and how we give back. In fact, our
            ethics are so important to us, they cannot adequately be summed up
            in one paragraph (sorry). That’s why we’ve dedicated a whole bunch
            of pages to them. If you’re ready to get readin’, just push the
            button below. But don’t say we didn’t warn you.
